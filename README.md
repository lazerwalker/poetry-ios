# Computational Flâneur

[![CI Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/lazerwalker/poetry-ios.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/lazerwalker/poetry-ios)


_Computational Flanêur_ is site-specific generative poetry walk built for Come Out and Play SF 2016. It combines a generative poetry engine (currently using [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn and a [pre-trained mode](https://github.com/rossgoodwin/neuralsnap) by Ross Goodwin) with speech synthesis, music synthesis and various sensor data as inputs.

This'll be updated soon with a link to the app itself, which will be a free download on the iOS App Store.


## Installation

The `Pods` folder is checked in. You should be able to just clone this, open `Poetry.xcworkspace`, and knock yourself out from there.
