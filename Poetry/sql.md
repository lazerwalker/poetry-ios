A bunch of the poetry snippets generated by the RNN tend to contain title page information. 

While I'm still figuring out a long-term automated solution to filter these out, for now I'm manually massaging the SQLite database. 

Consider this file a scratchpad of things I'm doing manually.

Delete all snippets that contain a year in parentheses:

`delete from stanzas where text regexp "\(\d{4}"`
